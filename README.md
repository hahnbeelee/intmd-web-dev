# intmd-web-dev
Projects from INFO 2300 (Intermediate Web Development) @ Cornell University
## Core Objectives I Gained from this Course
- Developed competency in server-side web programming.
- Dynamically generated web content (HTML) using a programming language (PHP).
- Populated website content from a database using SQL.
- Gained understanding of the relationship between client and server and how to communicate between the two (HTTP).
- Designed website interactivity that is appropriate for a specific target audience.

## Project Descriptions
### Project 1 - Personal Photography Display Site
This is a website built with PHP that promotes my photography. Specifically it is a small dynamic 3-4 page website about photography created for two target audiences.
#### Skills Gained From this Project
- Learned to design for multiple target audiences.
- Implemented a dynamic web site with PHP.
- Used templates to reuse web page components across a website.
- Processed user input server-side.
- Improved form usability for with _sticky forms_.

### Project 2 - Personal Database Site of my Favorite Movies 
Project 2 is a small catalog website that displays a collection of objects (my favorite movies) in a database.

Through Project 2, I learned how to use a database to render the contents of a web page. To develop these skills I built a small catalog website. I stored the data for my catalog in a SQLite database. I then wrote a PHP web page to read the contents of the database and then presented the data in a usable form for the web.
#### Skills Gained From this Project
- Continuation of developing my algorithm based problem solving skills.
  - Developed good programming habits: planning first and then implementation.
  - Furthered my development of my _programmer's toolbox_ to solve problems with code.
- Exposure to the standard practice of backing website content with a database.
  - Using a database with PHP to populate the content of a web page.
  - Experience with using a development database: SQLite.
  - Basics of database schema design.
  - Exposure to basic SQL queries and security measures to prevent SQL injection.
  - Practice with _filter input, escape output_ for HTTP parameters to help secure your web site.

### Project 3 - Photo Gallery with User Access Controls
In Project 3 I designed and implemented an online photo gallery in PHP. My photo gallery is backed by a database which stores information about the images uploaded to my gallery. To help organize the photos in my gallery, I implemented the ability for users of my site to tag the photos. I also implemented a login/logout functionality and user access controls to control who can upload photos on my site.
#### Skills Gained From this Project
- Experience building an entire website applying the techniques we've learned thus far.
- Develop the skills to translate client/customer requirements into a working implementation.
- Practice using your *web programmer's toolkit* to solve complex problems.
- Practice structuring a database with multiple tables and foreign keys.
- Practice building and querying relationships between tables using common fields (joins).
- Working knowledge of how to implement support for user accounts for a website with sessions and cookies.

### Project 4 (Brown Fox) - Site for a Language Organization on Campus
Project 4 was a group project. We created a website for a language translation/learning organization on campus. Throughout this project gained experience on how to build a website for a client. This project developed my teamwork and client skills. However, I also gained additional experience designing and building complex web sites.
#### Skills Gained From this Project
- Gained practical experience working with an actual client.
- Developed my *web programmer's toolkit* to help me solve complex problems with a basic set of tools and methods.
- Increased my self assessment skills to evaluate my own work; evaluated my work to determine if I've met client and project requirements.
- Experience with non-user based evaluation techniques for testing the effectiveness of my designs.
- Awareness of gender-inclusiveness *bugs* and their impact on potential users.
- Improving my teamwork skills to help me prepare for work outside of school.
